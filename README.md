# Drug Activity Prediction ðŸš€

### Overview
This repository contains a project aimed at predicting the biological activity of drug molecules using machine learning techniques. The objective is to classify drug molecules based on their potential efficacy against specific biological targets.

### Problem Statement
Drug discovery is a long and costly process, and predicting the activity of molecules early can significantly reduce the time and cost involved. The goal of this project is to use data-driven approaches to predict the activity of drug molecules based on their chemical structure and properties.

### Key Features
- **Feature Engineering**: Use molecular descriptors and fingerprints to represent chemical properties of drug molecules.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Train and evaluate various models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize models for better accuracy and generalization.
- **Model Interpretability**: Explain model predictions using SHAP values and feature importance.

### Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: The dataset consists of drug molecules with known activity labels (active/inactive).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling numerical features.
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Generate molecular descriptors using RDKit.
   - Create molecular fingerprints for similarity-based predictions.
4. **Model Training**:
   - Build models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
   - Use cross-validation for robust evaluation.
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
6. **Interpretation**:
   - Use SHAP values to understand the contribution of different molecular features to the predictions.
